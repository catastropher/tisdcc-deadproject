Notes:
  * B_CALLs that "destroy all" -- includes ix (until proven otherwise)
    * Do we care about AF? I think SDCC expects Acc trashing across
      function calls, but I'm not sure.
  * Some B_CALLs that check flags need TIOS' iy value (so save ours
    first, and restore theirs' before B_CALLing, then restore ours)
