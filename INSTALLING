To install tisdcc:
  * make install              # install. You can override BINDIR, DOCDIR,
                              # and set DESTDIR to install to a buildroot.
                              # Additionally SDCC and SDCCAS can be
                              # overridden (they default to Fedora's, i.e.
                              # sdcc and sdcc-as-z80).
                              #
                              # Debian example:
                              # make install PREFIX=/usr SDCCAS=as-z80
