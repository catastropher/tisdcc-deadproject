This is TISDCC -- A toolchain and library set for programming in C for
programmable calculators based on the z80 CPU.

Directories:
  * doc/      - Documentation.
  * include/  - Headers for user programs to include.
  * lib/      - Libraries for user programs to use.
  * pctools/  - Tools for compiling user programs.

Design goals:
We want to facilitate compiling for calculators, however it is not a design
goal that porting to different calculator models be trivial. This means
that if you want your C program to run on TI-83, TI-86, TI-83+, you are
responsible for any #ifdef/#define magic needed to make that happen. Instead,
we choose to provide ti83.h, ti86.h, ti83p.h, etc.

Tools:
We provide
  * libtisdcc - To pre-process, (and optionally) compile, assemble, and link
    C programs.
  * tisdcc - A frontend program for libtisdcc (aims to preserve GCC's
    interface when possible).

Dependencies:
You will need
  * Python (tested on 2.6, but probably works on 2.5).
  * SDCC (tested against 2.9.0).
